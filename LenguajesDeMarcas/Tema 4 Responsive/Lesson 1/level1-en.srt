2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,930
Welcome to Journey
into Mobile.

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,650
This is level one, Foundations
for Mobile.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,800
And in this level,
we're going to be

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,410
covering three main things.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,850
First, we're going to be talking
about what is the

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,890
mobile web.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,460
Then second, we're going to
cover a brief overview of the

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,619
course, and then finally,
we're going to look at

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,310
relative font sizing.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,950
So let's first talk about
the mobile web.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,420
So what is the mobile web?

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,650
Well, there's actually no mobile
web, in as much as

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,900
there isn't necessarily
say a desktop web.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,780
You see, this isn't the web.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,300
This is the web.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,120
And what I mean by that is that
the web isn't limited to

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,270
one particular device or one
particular environment.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,060
Tim Berners-Lee has a great
thought here where he says

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,710
that the primary design
principle underlying the web's

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,560
usefulness and growth
is universality.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,140
And that's really what we're
talking about here.

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,880
We're talking about
the universal web.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,350
See, the web must work with
any form of information.

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,400
And it must be accessible
from any device.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,990
And that's really our
responsibility as web

27
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,830
designers and web developers,
is to make sure that our

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,470
designs, that are sites, work
on the universal web.

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,760
That they don't just work in a
desktop environment, or just

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,240
work in a mobile environment.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,230
So our goal is to make sure that
we are working towards

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,600
this universal web.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,690
Because, at the end of the day,
this will be the web.

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,960
We're going to see many more
devices come out, many more

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,020
environments that we're going to
have to make sure that our

36
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,900
sites and that our applications
actually work in.

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,480
So when we talk about mobile
design, or adaptive design, or

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,530
even responsive design, really
all we're talking about is

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,340
just web design.

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,590
So in this course, we're going
to look at three main areas.

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,140
First, we're going to cover
fluid layouts and why those

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,110
are important.

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,750
Second, we're going to talk
about adaptive design.

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,900
And then finally, we're going
to wrap up talking about

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,360
responsive design.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,770
But before we get into any of
that, we're going to cover a

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,650
little bit about fluid
typesetting.

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,185
And here's what I
mean with that.

49
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,900
Here's the image that we're
going to be working with.

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's first take a look at the
mark-up for this image.

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,310
It's pretty simple.

52
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,490
All we have is an h1
with a link inside.

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,640
Let's take a look at how our
styles render for this

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,410
particular mark-up.

55
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,880
Once again, pretty simple.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,540
Our h1, we have it set at 30
pixels for our font size.

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,080
And this would be fine, except
that we want our fonts to be

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,530
proportional, or relative in
size, so that when we talk

59
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,520
about scaling sites we
can actually have our

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,410
font scale with us.

61
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,790
So instead of having our font
size be 30 pixels, we actually

62
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,660
want to convert our pixel
values into ems.

63
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,600
So I'm going to show
you how to do that.

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,270
The standard font size for most
browsers is 16 pixels.

65
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,000
But, as you know, browsers
can be kind of finicky.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,440
So we want to make sure that for
all of the browsers that

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,490
we're working with we have a
standard font size set on our

68
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,690
HTML element.

69
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,280
So that's why we've gone ahead
and set our standard font size

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,450
to be 16 pixels.

71
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,580
But you'll notice down below
that I've also got another

72
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,330
declaration for font size
in our body element.

73
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,910
I've got this size set
at 62 and 1/2%.

74
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,600
Now, what is this for?

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Well, since our standard font
size is 16 pixels, that means

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,850
that one em is equal
to 16 pixels.

77
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,910
But 16 is kind of a rough
number to divide by.

78
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,530
And you'll see why that
matters in a minute.

79
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,380
So what we've done here is we've
actually taken 62 and

80
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,470
1/2% of 16, which is 10.

81
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,250
So we've converted our font size
to be from 16 pixels to

82
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,500
10 pixels, which is going
to be a much easier

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,910
value to divide by.

84
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,940
Now why does that matter?

85
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,050
Well, we're going to be using
this formula in order to

86
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,740
convert our pixel
values into ems.

87
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,020
This formula is target divided
by context equals our result.

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,020
And, in this case, our target is
our target font size, which

89
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,230
we want to divide by
the font size of

90
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,520
our containing element.

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,270
And that's going to give
us the value that we

92
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,820
need for our ems.

93
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,720
So, in this case, we take our
30 pixels, which was the

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,250
value of our h1.

95
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,210
We're going to divide that by
our standard default font

96
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,180
size, which is 10 pixels.

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,870
And then we get our
value of 3 ems.

98
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,190
So we plug that back
into our CSS.

99
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,110
In place of 30 pixels,
now we have 3 ems.

100
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,290
And, voila, we've
got our relative

101
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,160
proportional font size.

102
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,770
So that's great.

103
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,820
As you can see from our
image here, it looks

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,290
relatively the same.

105
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,380
But we still have to work on
that link because our link

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,470
inside of our h1 is
now inheriting the

107
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,210
properties for our h1.

108
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,870
So let's go ahead and do that.

109
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,510
For our link we have it set at
14 pixels, and we need to

110
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,190
convert our pixel
values into ems.

111
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,090
So we're going to use
our formula again.

112
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,600
Now, would we do the same
thing that we do before?

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,890
In this case, 14
divided by 10.

114
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, let's see how
that looks.

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,910
Unfortunately, that doesn't
work, and that's because we

116
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,630
have the wrong context.

117
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,790
You see, in this case, our
context is not the default

118
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,440
browser font size, but actually
the size of our h1,

119
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,320
because our link is inside
of our h1 element.

120
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,100
So in this case, we actually
need to change our context

121
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,690
value from 10 pixels to 30
pixels because, remember, 30

122
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,710
pixels was the original
as of our h1 element.

123
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,300
So if we do this, we get this
value, and we can plug that

124
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,360
into our CSS.

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,920
And now it renders properly.

126
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
One quick note here.

127
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,150
You might have noticed with our
last conversion that it's

128
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,360
a pretty ugly number.

129
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,490
But that's OK.

130
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,320
We really should let
the browser do the

131
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,170
heavy lifting here.

132
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,280
We don't need to round up or
round down because this is

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,220
actually the exact value of
our original pixel size.

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,920
So, in this case, we're
not going to round.

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,730
We're just going to keep that
value like so, plug it in to

136
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,001
our CSS, and it's going
work just fine.

137
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,920
So why do we spend the time
covering relative font sizing?

138
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,230
We're supposed to be talking
about mobile design, right?

139
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,120
Well, yes.

140
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,720
But see, it's important for you
to understand the formula

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,750
for actually converting pixels
to ems because when we start

142
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,550
talking about fluid layouts and
layouts that scale, we're

143
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,020
actually going to be using
the same formula.

144
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,970
So it's important for you to
grasp the concept, and this is

145
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,240
a pretty easy way for
you to do that.

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,860
So this level is fairly
simplistic, and the challenges

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,260
might not be all that
difficult for

148
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,370
you, but that's OK.

149
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,000
We're going to get to
more advanced stuff

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,250
later on in the course.
