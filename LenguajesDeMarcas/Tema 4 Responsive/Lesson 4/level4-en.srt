00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,830
You're watching Journey into
Mobile, and this is Level 4,

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,650
Responsive Adventures.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,860
In this level, we're going to be
talking a little bit about

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,610
the Mobile First design
approach, then we're going to

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,800
talk about how to apply
responsive design, and

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,260
finally, we're going to
wrap up with some

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,220
advanced media queries.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,240
So when we talk about the Mobile
First approach, Luke

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,080
Wroblewski, who sort of
pioneered the concept, has

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,360
three important items
to consider.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,900
He talks about Mobile First
as preparing you for the

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,530
explosive growth and
new opportunities

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,940
on the mobile internet.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,570
Secondly, the Mobile First
approach forces you to focus.

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,220
And finally, it enables you to
innovate in ways that you

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,850
previously couldn't.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,320
The Mobile First approach forces
you to focus on the

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,410
most important things
in your design.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,720
It forces you to simplify
the content.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,500
It forces you to prioritize the
layout, and it forces you

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
to optimize the user
experience.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,160
Because, if you think about it,
in a mobile design, you

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,600
don't have near the screen real
estate as you do in a

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,080
desktop environment.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,990
So your space is much more
valuable in a mobile design,

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,900
which means you can't just have
filler material, random

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,160
photos, or random pieces
of information.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,250
You really have to prioritize.

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,060
And this is a great design
concept because as we talk

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,920
about the universal web, we need
to make sure that both

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,770
our design and our content
is optimized for this.

33
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,000
The Mobile First approach
provides great foundation for

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,020
responsive design.

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,580
Now, one of the things you
might be asking is, is

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,200
adaptive design the same thing
as responsive design?

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,580
Well, all responsive designs
could be classified as

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,190
adaptive designs, but not
all adaptive designs are

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,340
responsive.

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,510
You see, responsive designs are
essentially fluid sites

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,930
with a series of break points,
whereas adaptive designs are

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,100
selectively optimized for the
context that you're targeting.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,570
Ethan Marcotte talks about
responsive designs as

44
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,320
providing continuity
between context.

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,850
And that responsive designs
are also portable and

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,940
accessible.

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,290
And when we're talking about
designing for the universal

48
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,350
web, these concepts are more
important than ever.

49
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,420
So let's kind of recap where
we've come thus far.

50
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,140
We talked about fluid layouts,
which are great except they do

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,580
have limitations when it comes
to view port size.

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,620
As you saw, as we started to get
smaller and smaller, the

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,810
site basically became
unreadable.

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,490
So that's not a great
universal solution.

55
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,450
We also talked about adaptive
designs, which are great for

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,860
targeted context, but it doesn't
necessarily cover all

57
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,620
of the universal web.

58
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,360
Now we're talking about
responsive design, which is

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
both flexible and universal.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,960
Because, again, we're providing
continuity between a

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,990
variety of different contexts.

62
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,660
Which means we can ensure that
there's an optimal design

63
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,270
experience, whether you're
looking at the site in a

64
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,700
desktop environment, a mobile
environment, or, really,

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,540
anywhere in between.

66
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,430
When we talk about responsive
design, our content defines

67
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,630
our break points.

68
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,400
Remember, in adaptive design,
the height and width of the

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,870
device determined
our break point.

70
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,590
But in this case, our break
points are determined by the

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,550
content of our site and where
that breaks down.

72
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,130
Because, remember, in responsive
design, our goal is

73
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,370
to create a seamless design
experience across a variety of

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,660
different contexts.

75
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,680
So where our site design breaks
down, that's where we

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
want to make sure
we optimize it.

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,670
So back to our demo site, The
Nautilus Bar and Restaurant.

78
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,840
As we look at our site we can
see that at around 870 pixels

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,700
our site gets a little
crammed up at the top

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,050
in our header section.

81
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,420
So this is going to be our first
break point where we

82
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,050
realize a need to optimize
the design for

83
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,680
this view port size.

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,670
So here's how we're going
to go about that.

85
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,190
We're going to use the same
formatting for our media query

86
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,970
as we discussed before, and
we're going to set our max

87
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,200
width at 870 pixels.

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm just going to give you a
couple of examples in our CSS

89
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,740
about what we want
to change here.

90
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,625
I'm not necessarily going to
go over all of the changes,

91
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,930
but what you need to remember
is that for any media query

92
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,750
that you're inputting into your
site, everything that you

93
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,500
want changed needs to be within
that media query.

94
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,120
So, for instance, if you want
to clear a float you need to

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,649
make sure that you actually
define that in your media

96
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,410
query, otherwise it's just going
to inherit the property

97
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,630
that was in your original
styles.

98
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,710
So what we've done in this case
is we're actually going

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,650
to use a new logo image, and
we're going to move all of our

100
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,870
location information beneath
that logo image.

101
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,940
So you can see the styles
that we've used to

102
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,060
achieve that here.

103
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,630
And here's what it looks
like in the browser.

104
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,720
So, as you can see, we've moved
everything underneath

105
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,270
our logo, we've flushed or
information left and right,

106
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,760
and this is a great optimal
design for that break point,

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,480
which we talked about earlier.

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,870
Now we also see another issue
at about 768 pixels.

109
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,940
At this point our menu items
start to get a little too

110
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,620
skinny, and the text becomes
hard to read.

111
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,560
So this would be another good
place to set a break point.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,870
Now, we've let our content
define where our break points

113
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,450
are, but it's also a good point
to notice here that's

114
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,990
768 pixels is a standard width
for tablet devices.

115
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,000
So, yes, you want to have your
content drive the break points

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
for your site, but it's also a
good idea to keep in mind some

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,100
of the devices that you have.

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,970
In order to optimize
for those as well.

119
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,710
So as you can see from our
styles here, what we're

120
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,770
changing is we're actually going
to stack our menu items

121
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,220
on top of each other similar to
what we did in our mobile

122
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,120
environment.

123
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,860
We're going to clear some
floats, and we're going to

124
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,550
stretch the width across
the view port.

125
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,240
So, as you can see, instead of
those being skinny and floated

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,190
to the left and right of each
other, we've got them stacked,

127
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,770
the width stretches across the
view port, and this is much

128
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,420
easier to read now.

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,190
Finally, we see another issue
happening at about 510 pixels

130
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,000
where the contact information
starts to break below the

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,790
location information.

132
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,250
So we could set another break
point here, but if you

133
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,970
remember back to our adaptive
level, we actually have

134
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,900
already set our mobile
styles with a media

135
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,320
query at 480 pixels.

136
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,680
And, once again, since this
site is built on a fluid

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,010
foundation, our site can
scale appropriately.

138
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,560
So instead of declaring a whole
other media query, and

139
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,290
having more and more styles
put in there, why not just

140
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,240
move our media query up from
480 pixels to 510 pixels.

141
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,400
So, in this case, at 510 pixels
our site is going to

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,730
break into those mobile styles,
it's going to clear up

143
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,630
that issue that we saw, and it's
also going to optimize

144
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,880
for those device sizes.

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, so we're going
to start at our

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,470
desktop view port size.

147
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,830
And what I'm going to do is
scale the browser down.

148
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,100
And as you can see, at those
break points that we defined,

149
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,030
the site design changes.

150
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,290
So instead of our site breaking,
we actually have our

151
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,420
site being optimized for these
break point sizes.

152
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,190
And we can get all the way down
to a mobile environment.

153
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,840
So from a mobile environment
all the way up to a desktop

154
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,660
environment, our site design
it's optimized for the user.

155
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,360
Now, nobody's going to sit here
and scale their browser

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,290
up and down, except if you're
a designer or a developer.

157
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,790
So our goal here is not
necessarily to create a design

158
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,150
that works when you scale your
browser size up and down, the

159
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,550
point is that at each of those
sizes the site design works.

160
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,800
So if a user is accessing a
site on a mobile device, on

161
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,010
a tablet device, on a small
laptop, on a large laptop, on

162
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,900
a large monitor, the site design
is going to look great

163
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,070
and it's going to be optimized
for the user experience.

164
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,150
Finally, we're going to take
a quick look at some of the

165
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,340
other options that we can
include in our media queries.

166
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,950
So here are a few charts from
Ethan Marcotte's book on

167
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,960
responsive web design, and
it shows you a number of

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,440
different options that you can
incorporate into your media

169
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,480
queries besides just min
width and max width.

170
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,220
So let's look at one of
these as an example.

171
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,770
So if we go back to our demo
site, here are some

172
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,640
screenshots of the site both
in portrait mode and in

173
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
landscape mode.

174
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Now, we've already optimized
the design with our media

175
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,280
queries, but what if we actually
wanted to call

176
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,690
specific device orientation.

177
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,510
So what if we wanted to have
specific styles, if the site

178
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,900
was in portrait mode, or the
site was in landscape mode?

179
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,990
Well, we can actually do that by
incorporating those values

180
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,450
into our media queries like
you can see here.

181
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,760
So instead of min width or max
width, what it becomes is

182
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,720
orientation portrait or
orientation landscape,

183
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,890
depending on what you
want to target.

184
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,240
The bottom line is, by using
media queries it gives us a

185
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,650
ton of flexibility in how we
design our sites, and how our

186
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,340
sites are optimized for a number
of different contexts,

187
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,520
and a number of different
devices.

188
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,770
Now it's time for you to work
on some challenges.

189
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,809
Good luck with those.

190
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,290
And we'll jump into
the next level.
